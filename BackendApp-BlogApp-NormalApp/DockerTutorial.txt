Here's a concise Docker command to download and run an Nginx container:

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

This command:
- Downloads the official Nginx image if not present locally
- Runs the container in detached mode (-d)
- Maps port 80 of the host to port 80 of the container (-p 80:80)

```
docker run -d -p 8081:80 nginx
```

This command will:
- Download the official Nginx image (if not already present)
- Run the container in detached mode (-d)
- Map port 8081 on your host machine to port 80 in the container (-p 8081:80)

After running this, you can access the Nginx default page by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8081`.

Do you need any additional information or modifications to this command?

Tutorial: Containerizing and Running the Spring Boot Blog Application

Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

First, create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project with the following content:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY target/*.jar app.jar

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

Step 2: Create a .dockerignore file

Create a `.dockerignore` file in the root directory to exclude unnecessary files:

```
.git
.gitignore
Dockerfile
*.md
target
```

Step 3: Build the application

Before building the Docker image, compile your Spring Boot application:

```
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

This command will create a JAR file in the `target` directory.

Step 4: Build the Docker image

Run the following command to build your Docker image:

```
docker build -t blogapp .
```

This command builds the image and tags it as "blogapp".

Step 5: Run the container

Now, you can run your application in a container:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name blogapp-container blogapp
```

This command:
- Runs the container in detached mode (-d)
- Maps port 8080 of the host to port 8080 of the container
- Names the container "blogapp-container"

Step 6: Verify the application is running

You can check if the container is running with:

```
docker ps
```

You should see your "blogapp-container" in the list.

Step 7: Test the application

You can now test your application by sending requests to `http://localhost:8080`. For example:

- To create a user: 
  ```
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"john","email":"john@example.com"}' http://localhost:8080/api/users
  ```

- To create a post:
  ```
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"My First Post","content":"Hello, World!","user":{"userId":1}}' http://localhost:8080/api/posts
  ```

- To get all posts:
  ```
  curl http://localhost:8080/api/posts
  ```

Step 8: Stop the container

When you're done, you can stop the container:

```
docker stop blogapp-container
```

Additional Notes:
1. Ensure your application.properties or application.yml file is configured correctly for database connections if you're using a database.
2. For a production environment, you might want to use environment variables for configuration instead of hardcoding values.
3. If you need to persist data, consider using Docker volumes.

This tutorial provides a basic setup. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to adjust the Dockerfile or add additional configuration.
